## Overview

The project is a responsive newsletter sign-up form with dynamic validation and a success message. The HTML document includes sections for user input and feedback, while the associated JavaScript code handles form submission, email validation, and success message display. Users receive real-time error messages for invalid inputs and are presented with a success message upon successful submission. A dismissible button in the success message allows users to clear the message and reload the page. Overall, the project combines form functionality with a clean and user-friendly interface.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
